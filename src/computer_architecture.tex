\section{Quantitative Measures}

\subsection{The Party Is Over}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Since 2003 processor performance improvement dropped to less
    than 22%/yr.
  \item Maximum power dissipation of air-cooled chips.
  \item Lack of more instruction level parallelism to exploit.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types of Parallelism}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data-level parallelism: More than one data item can be operated on at a
    time by the processor.
  \item Task-level parallelism: A task created can be operated on independently
    and largely in parallel.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallelism Approaches}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Instruction-level parallelism: Exploit data-level parallelism by
    executing multiple instrucitons in parallel on the same core.
    E.g. pipelining.
  \item Vector Architectures: Exploit data-level parallelism by applying a
    single instruction to more than one piece of data at a time.
  \item Thread-level parallelism: Data-level or task-level parallelism
    that allows for interaction between threads.
  \item Request-level parallelism: Task-level parallelism between .
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transistor Bottlenecks}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Transistor performance increases linearly with decreased feature size.
  \item Feature size is at it's limit. Lab \(1nm\), working
    \(5nm\) (not commercial).
  \item Power consumption problematic: On-chip power distribution is hard,
    transient power surges are challenges for power supplies, heat removal is
    an issue.
  \item Power consumption in chips is due to dynamic capacitive charging and
    shoot-through.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transitor Power Consumption}
\[  P_{dyn} \propto \frac{1}{2} C V^{2} f_{SW} \]
\[ P_{static} \propto i_{leakage} V_{CC} \]

\subsection{Cost Factors}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cost proportional to yield.
  \item Volume allows for improved manufacturing, amortised development costs.
  \item Costs decrease about 10\% by doubling volume.
  \item Commodity selling drives down prices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Chip Cost}

\[ C_{chip} = \frac{C_{die} + C_{testing} + C_{dev} + ...}{Y_{die}} \]
\[ C_{die} = \frac{C_{wafer}}{P \times Y_{die}} \]
\[ P = \frac{\pi (D_{wafer})^{2}}{A_{wafer}} -
  \frac{\pi \times D_{wafer}}{\sqrt{2 \times A_{wafer}}} \]
\[ Y_{die} = Y_{wafer} \times \frac{1}{(1 + K \times A)^{N}} \]
\[ N = 11.5 \rightarrow 15.5 \]
\[ K = 0.016 \rightarrow 0.057 / cm^2 \]

\subsection{Mean Time To Failure}
\[ A = \frac{MTTF}{MTTF + MTTR} \]
\[ FR_n = \frac{x_{n}}{MTTF_{n}} \]
\[ MTTF_{sys} = \frac{1}{\sum_{1}^{n} FR_{n}} \]

\subsection{Computer Performance}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \(IC\) is the instruction count of a process.
  \item \(CPI\) is the average clock cycles per instruction of a process. This
    takes into account pipeline stalls, cache misses, etc.
  \item \(N\) is the amount of clock cycles taken to complete a process.
\end{itemize}

\[ SR_{A} = \frac{T_{ref}}{T_{A}} \]
\[ FOM = \sqrt[n]{\overset{n}{\underset{i=1}{\Pi}} SR_{i}} \]
\[ S_{overall} = \frac{z}{z^+} = \frac{1}{(1-q) + q / S} \]
\[ N = \sum_{i=1}^{n} IC_{i} \times CPI_{i} \]
\[ CPI = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{IC_{i}}{IC_{overall}} \times CPI_{i} \]

\section{Memory Systems}

\subsection{Virtual Memory}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Provide a memory space that is larger than physical memory.
  \item Provide a caching mechanism for the disk memory.
  \item Provide a memory protection mechanism.
  \item Provide hardware support for program relocation.
  \item Virtual address consists of a segment number and an offset.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Segmentation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Facilitates logical organisation into different segments.
  \item Fine-grain protection.
  \item Different sizes make disk interaction harder.
  \item Can have global and local segment descriptor tables.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Paging}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Same size segments.
  \item Easy movement to and from disks.
  \item Not as good at protection.
\end{itemize}
